{gr8conf-url}[GR8Conf EU 2019] starts precisely in 13 days (on May 27th).
Each year Copenhagen becomes a heart of Groovy vibrant community for 3 days.
The conference offers both talks and workshops, focused on Groovy related topics such as upcoming Groovy 3 release, building DSLs, using Micronaut in the cloud-native environment, or testing applications with Spock and Geb, to name a few.
And that's not even a quarter of great stuff you can expect from it.
This year you can also attend one of my three talks I'm going to deliver.

== The invitation

If you wonder if it is worth dedicating your time to attend one of my presentations, here is a short video I recorded yesterday.
I explain what the goals of each talk are, what you can expect from them, and what kind of things you can learn during the presentation.
